### 4. Help Documentation Enhancement

#### User vs Tenant Management Documentation
**File**: `src/lib/help-documentation-kb.ts`
**Section**: "What's the difference between User Management and Tenant Management? (Super Admin)"

**Comprehensive Guide Includes:**

**USER MANAGEMENT Section:**
- What users are (individual login accounts)

**QUICK COMPARISON TABLE:**
| Aspect | User Management | Tenant Management |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|

## 🔄 Cache Version Bump Procedure (For Future Releases)

When deploying updates to the PWA, follow this procedure to ensure users get fresh content:

### Step 1: Update Cache Version
**File**: `public/sw.js`

Change the `CACHE_VERSION` constant to a new date-based version:
```javascript
// Before: const CACHE_VERSION = 'wmart-ai-2025-01-15-001';
// After:  const CACHE_VERSION = 'wmart-ai-2025-01-16-001';
```

**Format**: `wmart-ai-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`
- YYYY-MM-DD: Current date
- NNN: Increment for same-day releases (001, 002, etc.)

### Step 2: Clear Old Caches (Automatic)
The service worker automatically:
- Detects version change on activation
- Deletes all old cache versions
- Creates new cache with updated version

### Step 3: Test the Update
1. Deploy the changes
2. Open DevTools > Application > Service Workers
3. Click "Update" or hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Verify new cache version in Application > Cache Storage
5. Test that new assets are loaded

### When to Bump Cache Version:
- ✅ After any code deployment
- ✅ When updating static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- ✅ After changing manifest.json or service worker
- ✅ When fixing bugs or adding features

### When NOT to Bump:
- ❌ Minor content updates (blog posts, etc.)
- ❌ API-only changes (no frontend changes)
- ❌ Database migrations
- ❌ Configuration changes not affecting cached files
