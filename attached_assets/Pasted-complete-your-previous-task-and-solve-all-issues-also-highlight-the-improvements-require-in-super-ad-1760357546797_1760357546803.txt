Searched for "What are the main features and pages of the super admin panel?"

Decided on next development priorities (7 seconds)
Now let me read key files to understand the current state and what needs to be completed:


Created task list for improvements (6 seconds)
Perfect! I can see the current state of the application. The Token Limit field has already been added successfully. Now let me create a comprehensive task list to complete all the remaining issues and improvements:


Documented user vs tenant differences
Now I'll begin completing all the tasks systematically. Let me start with the first task:

Now let me add a comprehensive section explaining User Management vs Tenant Management:


Edited src/lib/help-documentation-kb.ts

Decided on documentation review status (4 seconds)

Explain user versus tenant management differences

Decided on continuing task 2
Now let me work on improving the Super Admin tenant management UI. Let me first examine the current implementation:


Opened src/app/dashboard/page.tsx

Decided on task delegation strategy (10 seconds)
Let me delegate the comprehensive mobile responsiveness work to a subagent since it requires extensive changes across multiple files:


Planned mobile responsiveness improvements
Now let me delegate the comprehensive mobile responsiveness work to a subagent:


Made the entire dashboard mobile responsive

Planned next steps for review
Excellent! The subagent has successfully implemented comprehensive mobile responsiveness. Now let me update the task list and add the service worker for PWA functionality:

Decided on testing and review approach
Let me check the logs to ensure everything is working correctly:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on icon 404 issue

Selected placeholder image strategy (4 seconds)
Let me create placeholder icon files for the PWA:


Decided on review and verification
Now let me call the architect to review all the changes I've made:

The architect found critical issues. Let me fix them immediately:


Opened src/lib/help-documentation-kb.ts

Decided on service worker improvements
The documentation is there! Let me fix the service worker issue now:


Planned service worker updates
Great! I've fixed the service worker. Now let me restart the server and check if everything works:


Called architect for review
Now let me call the architect again to review the fixed service worker:


Evaluated service worker offline fallback for protected routes

Determined service worker caching logic
The architect found another critical issue. Let me fix the service worker fetch handler to properly handle protected routes:


Verified server restart success
Now let me verify the fixes with the architect one final time:


Reviewing Agent's code
Task
Perform a final review of the service worker implementation, verifying that all applied fixes for caching, offline fallback, and error handling meet the expected behavior for different user types and routes.
