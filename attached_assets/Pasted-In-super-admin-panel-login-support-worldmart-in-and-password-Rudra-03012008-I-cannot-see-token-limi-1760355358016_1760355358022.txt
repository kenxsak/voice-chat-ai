Decided on plan field visibility (11 seconds)
I can see the issues! Let me investigate and fix them for you:

Token Limits not visible in Super Admin Plan view - You're right, the token limit field is missing from the plan edit screen
UI changes not showing - This could be a display/database issue
User Management vs Tenant Management - Let me clarify the difference
Let me start by checking the super admin plan management code:


Decided on API token limits
Good! I can see the token limits ARE defined in the database. Now let me find the super admin UI where the plan edit form is displayed:


Searched for "Find the super admin page component that displays the plan edit form with input fields for Monthly Price, Conversation Limit, Lead Limit, Agent Limit, Language Limit, Context Limit"

Decided on user/tenant management distinctions (5 seconds)
Now let me find the actual super admin page component where the plan edit form is displayed:


Decided on plan edit form
Perfect! Let me check the dashboard page where the super admin plan management is:


Opened src/app/dashboard/page.tsx

Decided on token limit field rendering
The file is very long! Let me search specifically for where the plan token limit field should be displayed:


Planned Monthly Price label placement
Found it! Let me read the plan edit form section:


Opened src/app/dashboard/page.tsx

Decided on token limit field addition (5 seconds)
Found the issue! Looking at lines 4105-4141, I can see the plan edit form has these fields:

Monthly Price (USD/INR)
Yearly Discount
Conversation Limit
Lead Limit
Agent Limit
Language Limit
Context Limit
Allow Custom Branding
But the Token Limit field is MISSING from the UI!

The token limits ARE stored in the database (50K for Free, 500K for Trial/Starter, 2M for Pro), but they're not showing in the super admin interface. Let me create a task list to fix all three issues:


Decided on token limit field addition
Let me check the Plan type definition and see what needs to be updated:


Decided on plan type update (4 seconds)
Perfect! I can see the problem clearly:

The Plan type (lines 248-284) is missing the tokenLimit property! It has all other limits (conversation, lead, agent, language, context) but not token limit.

Let me delegate this task to add the token limit field:


Adding Token Limit field
Task
Add a tokenLimit field to the Plan type, INITIAL_PLANS_DATA, and the UI form in the dashboard plan management interface to store and manage token limits.

Show more
Perfect! I can see the API already supports tokenLimit in the database. Now let me take a screenshot to verify the Token Limit field is displaying correctly in the UI:
