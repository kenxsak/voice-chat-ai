The chatbot should be clean, modern, and seamlessly integrated with both light and dark themes.

ðŸ”§ Core Functional Requirements

Must include a chat container with smooth open/close animation.

A chat bubble or icon button fixed at the bottom-right corner.

When clicked, the chat window should expand smoothly with a typing area, send button, and scrollable message list.

The message system should handle user messages and bot responses properly â€” responses should appear with a typing animation.

Each message (user and bot) should have a distinct bubble style.

Ensure auto-scroll to the latest message and smooth message transitions.

Implement loading indicator (e.g., three-dot typing animation) while waiting for a response.

Include placeholder text, keyboard accessibility, and mobile responsiveness.

ðŸŽ¨ UI / UX Design & Theming

Use a professional, minimal aesthetic inspired by modern SaaS UI design.

Support Light Mode and Dark Mode:

Light Mode: White background, subtle gray borders, black text, muted hover states.

Dark Mode: Dark gray or near-black background, white text, soft white hover states.

Replace any bright accent (like pink) with neutral or corporate tones â€” e.g., blue, gray, or accent color that suits the siteâ€™s branding.

Use rounded corners (border-radius: 1rem) and slight drop shadows for depth.

Font should be inter, poppins, or any modern sans-serif with good readability.

ðŸ§© Technical Setup

Written in React (with TailwindCSS) or Vanilla JS + CSS, depending on whatâ€™s suitable.

Include full state management for message handling (user + bot).

Easy to integrate into any site (just drop-in script or React component).

The code should be clean, modular, and maintainable.

ðŸ§  Optional Enhancements

Add timestamp to each message (hover to view).

Allow toggling dark/light mode manually or automatically detect system theme.

Allow basic bot personality customization (name, avatar, greeting message).

Allow greeting popup after 3 seconds of page load (optional).

ðŸŽ¯ Final Goal

Deliver a ready-to-use professional chatbot widget that feels polished, modern, and reliable â€” not just visually appealing but functionally complete with smooth message flow, animations, and responsive theme design.
