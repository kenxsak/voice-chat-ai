for past task completed follow repli.md all funcions which are working do not disturm only problems need to be solved . Prblems identified 1) Multiple Enteries of data entry for same customer at different time stamps - It seems its capturing 1st Name , email , and phone after that new message creating for other business details there after other mesage of full log. Its Capturing 2 to 3 times same customer data at different time stamps and showing in recent interaction. Last interaction which is done has full log conversations and rest 2 half half half . Because of this conversational count aswell leads count will falter and limits will be reached as per plan fast. Give proper solutions also my suggestion once the chat start till end it should capture all data at one place and when anyone close the chat or refresh page than it needs to consider as one conversation and entire log conversations need to be captured in same full conversation . repeat customer is one who comes back again and start the new chat with same contact details like ( email , phone ) if email and phone both are different than only consider as a new customer lead. Please suggest if this can be better maangement for new leads , repeated customers with same details with sales and support with or without single on multiple image . look for all the combinations what can be the best way without any duplications . also all chats after 3 months should get auto deleted as the leads will automatically sync to any crm and our monthly calculations are in place so customer can only access data or history of past data for follow up till 90 Days only there after Past data can have delete all options or single data or auto delete option activated to reduce the load of data on server. Please go through all my suggestions and if any better standard way saas company maange you can guide with best practice if i am going somewhere wrong. attacheed screen shots for better undersatnding . 2) Conversational full log if in any language and tenanat needed to understand by translation in any language not working as this was working before

Got it! The current matching logic (email OR phone) works for your needs. Let me update the task list and move on to the remaining issues:
as repeat customer you suggest what is best

Great question! Let me give you the **SaaS industry best practice** for identifying repeat customers: ## Recommended Approach: **Email as Primary Identifier** **Best Practice:** 1. **Email = Primary unique identifier** (Most reliable and stable) 2. **Phone = Secondary/supplementary** (Can change or be shared) 3. A customer is "returning" if their **email matches** 4. If no email provided, use phone as fallback **Why this works best:** - ✅ Email is unique per person (industry standard) - ✅ Works with CRM systems (most use email as primary key) - ✅ Prevents false positives (family members sharing phones) - ✅ Reduces duplicate leads - ✅ More stable over time (people change phones more than emails) **Your current system** (email OR phone matching) is actually fine for most cases, but can sometimes create false positives when: - Family members share a phone number - Business phone used by multiple people - Someone changes their phone but uses same email **My recommendation:** Keep the current OR logic, but **prioritize email matching** when both are available. The existing system already handles this well. Should I proceed with fixing the remaining issues (translation feature and 90-day data retention)? The duplicate entry problem is already solved!

Decided on language localization strategy
I can see the AI summary translation dropdown still has hardcoded languages. The previous update didn't complete properly. Let me fix this now:


Updated TranslatableText component with all languages

Decided on AI summary translation dropdown
Excellent! Now all translation dropdowns including the AI Summary have all 109 languages available. Let me update the task list and move to the final task - data retention:


Decided on data retention system approach
Perfect! Now let me implement the 90-day data retention policy with auto-delete system:


Implementing data retention policy
Task
