You have created User Management so explain how is it different from Tennant Managements screen shot attached 2) This things are alreadxy there and working please recheck once as we added few things recently like tokens. Plans section which can support 14 days of free premium plan have free premium all features experience if not renewed can get converted as free plan. Super admin can have proper restrictions as per plans attached all 3 plans screen shot . we had just added tokens whcic are still not controled by super admi as it can maange leads and total conversion control with agent , language , context limits with no logo branding allowed in free plan and it will have saas platform branding aswell website link. any thing to add here please guide to properly control the cost if incurred more in future with google gemini api so all plans should always remain profitable and have proper margins and always allow customer to push to upgrade to get more features to make my saas company profitable as well competitive with other players. Guide if its following everything aswell any other suggestion . Just to save cost we have chose conversational chat bot to real aloud text and have feeling like its actually talking and not like eleven labs conversational voice chat bot with actually talks like talking on phone immeediately but the cost is high from converting voice to text and than converting tesxt to voice. Main Idea was cost saving and giving same feeling like human agent giving sales and support. only problem what i see is just processing time right now as there is waiting time now truley conversational guide on that 3) Last but not least i just seen ai help not picking up data from help doc mentioned any things need update since we added languages aswell currency and all country if any things need update do it.
