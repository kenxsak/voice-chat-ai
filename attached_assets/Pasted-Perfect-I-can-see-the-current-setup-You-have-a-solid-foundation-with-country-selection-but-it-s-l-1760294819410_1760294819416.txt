Perfect! I can see the current setup. You have a solid foundation with country selection, but it's limited to just 5 countries. Let me create a comprehensive plan to make this a truly global platform with all countries, currencies, and languages.

üìä Current State Analysis
Countries: Only 5 (US, India, UK, Canada, Australia)
Currencies: USD and INR with basic logic (INR for India, USD for others)
Languages: ~25 languages (Indian languages + major world languages)

üåç Proposal for True Global Platform
Here's my recommendation to make VoiceChat AI truly global:

1. All Countries (~195 countries)
Complete list of all countries with ISO codes
Each country mapped to its local currency
Proper currency symbols (‚Çπ, $, ‚Ç¨, ¬£, ¬•, ‚Ç©, etc.)
2. Multi-Currency Pricing System
Major Currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, INR, JPY, CNY, AUD, CAD, BRL, MXN, etc.
Dynamic pricing based on purchasing power parity (PPP)
Currency conversion with exchange rates
Local payment methods integration via Stripe
3. Extended Language Support (~100+ languages)
Currently: 25 languages
Proposed additions:

European: Dutch, Polish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Czech, Greek, Romanian, Hungarian
Asian: Thai, Filipino, Malay, Burmese, Khmer, Lao, Nepali, Sinhala, Urdu, Persian (Farsi)
Middle Eastern: Hebrew, Kurdish, Pashto
African: Swahili, Zulu, Amharic, Hausa, Yoruba, Afrikaans
Others: Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Icelandic, Maltese
4. Regional Customization
Date/time formats per region
Phone number formats
Address formats
RTL (Right-to-Left) support for Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu
Would you like me to implement this? I can:

‚úÖ Create a complete countries database with all ~195 countries + currencies
‚úÖ Expand language support to 100+ languages
‚úÖ Build dynamic pricing system with currency conversion
‚úÖ Add RTL language support for Arabic/Hebrew markets
‚úÖ Integrate Stripe for multi-currency payments (if needed)
Let me know which parts you'd like me to prioritize, and I'll start implementing!
