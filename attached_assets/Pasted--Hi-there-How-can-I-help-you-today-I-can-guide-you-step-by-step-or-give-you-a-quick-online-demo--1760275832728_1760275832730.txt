need to add products but dont know from where to add

Okay, I can definitely guide you with adding products! You can add products individually or in bulk from the "Catalogue" section of your dashboard. To add products individually, go to Catalogue > Add Products and fill in the details. For bulk import, use the provided Excel template! This will help you in faster billing and clearer reports.

can i know where will i find this section in dashboard as i am not able to see this

Okay, I can help you find the "Catalogue" section! Once you're logged into Posible POS, look for a menu on the left-hand side of your dashboard. You should see "Catalogue" listed there - click on it to expand, and you'll find the "Add Products" option. If you're still having trouble, you can check out our help articles on Posible.in for a visual guide! Just search for "adding products" in the knowledge base.

There seems to be a misunderstanding! As an AI, I don't actually store personal information. Perhaps you're thinking of a previous interaction with Posible support, or you may have entered your details during the registration process. Regardless, your privacy is important. Let's focus on your question about adding products – were you able to locate the "Catalogue" section in your dashboard?
