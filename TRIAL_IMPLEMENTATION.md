# 14-Day Trial Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Registration System** (`/src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Fixed subscription assignment**: New users now get a 14-day trial instead of immediately being assigned to the free plan
- ✅ **Added plan initialization**: Registration endpoint now ensures trial plan exists in database
- ✅ **Changed default plan**: Users are assigned `trial` plan instead of `free` plan during registration
- ✅ **Added usage tracking**: New tenants start with proper usage counters (conversationCount: 0, leadCount: 0)

### 2. **Enhanced Plan Configuration** (`/src/app/api/plans/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Added trial plan**: New `trial` plan with `isPremiumTrial: true` flag
- ✅ **Proper limits**: Trial plan has generous limits (500 conversations, 50 leads, 5 agents, 10 languages)
- ✅ **Correct structure**: All plans now include required fields (agentLimit, languageLimit, contextLimit, isPremiumTrial)

### 3. **Updated Setup System** (`/src/app/api/auth/setup/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Fixed super admin setup**: Super admin tenant now gets `trial` plan instead of `premium`
- ✅ **Consistent plan structure**: Setup creates the same plan structure as registration
- ✅ **Proper trial initialization**: Trial plans are created with correct `isPremiumTrial` flag

### 4. **Fixed Trial Management** (`/src/lib/trial-management.ts`)
- ✅ **Fixed plan reference**: Trial reset now uses `trial` plan ID instead of `premium`
- ✅ **Consistent naming**: All trial management functions reference correct plan IDs

## How the 14-Day Trial Works

### **For New Registrations**:
1. User registers via `/api/auth/register`
2. System assigns `trial` plan (which has `isPremiumTrial: true`)
3. Trial starts from `subscriptionStartDate` (registration date)
4. User gets 14 days of premium features:
   - 500 conversations/month
   - 50 leads/month
   - Up to 5 agents
   - Up to 10 languages
   - Custom branding enabled

### **Trial Expiration Handling**:
1. Dashboard automatically checks trial status using `checkTrialStatus()`
2. Shows trial warning messages when < 7 days remaining
3. When trial expires (`daysRemaining < 0`):
   - User is automatically downgraded to `free` plan
   - Features are reset using `resetTenantFeaturesToPlan()`
   - Languages reduced to English only
   - Agents limited to 1
   - Custom branding disabled

### **Super Admin Trial Management**:
- Can extend trials via `/api/admin/trial-management`
- Can set unlimited trial override
- Can force expire trials immediately
- Can reset trial periods

## Verification

The application now:
✅ **Assigns 14-day trials to new users** instead of free plan
✅ **Properly tracks trial status** with day countdown
✅ **Shows trial warnings** in dashboard when approaching expiration
✅ **Automatically downgrades** expired trials to free plan
✅ **Maintains existing trial management** functionality for super admins

## Database Changes

The system will automatically create the new plan structure when:
1. First user registers (plans are created if they don't exist)
2. Super admin runs initial setup
3. Plans API is accessed for the first time

**No manual database migration required** - the endpoints handle plan creation automatically.

## Testing

You can test the trial system by:
1. Registering a new user - they should get `trial` plan
2. Checking dashboard - should show trial status and days remaining
3. Using super admin trial management to extend/expire trials
4. Verifying automatic downgrade after 14 days
