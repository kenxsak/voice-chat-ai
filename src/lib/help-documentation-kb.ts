### What are AI tokens and why do they matter?

**AI Tokens Explained:**
- Tokens are units of text processed by the AI (roughly 4 characters = 1 token)
- Every conversation uses tokens for both user messages and AI responses
- Example: A 100-word conversation â‰ˆ 400 tokens
- Images count as approximately 258 tokens each

**Why Token Limits Matter:**
- Tokens directly correlate to AI processing costs
- Each plan has a monthly token allowance to ensure profitability
- When you exceed your token limit, conversations pause until next billing cycle
- Upgrading gives you higher token limits for more conversations

**Token Usage Tips:**
- Keep training data concise and relevant
- Avoid uploading duplicate or unnecessary documents
- Use context limits wisely (don't add more contexts than needed)
- Monitor token usage in Analytics dashboard

### What's the difference between User Management and Tenant Management? (Super Admin)

**Understanding the Key Differences:**

**USER MANAGEMENT:**
User Management is for managing individual user accounts on the platform. Each user has:
- Email address (login credentials)
- Role assignment (Super Admin, Admin, or User)
- Tenant association (which company/organization they belong to)
- Account creation date

**What Super Admins Can Do:**
- Create new user accounts with specific roles
- Assign users to tenants (organizations)
- Delete users (except themselves)
- View all users across the platform
- Filter users by role or search by email

**When to Use:**
- Creating login accounts for new administrators
- Assigning team members to specific organizations
- Managing platform access and permissions
- Removing inactive or unauthorized accounts

---

**TENANT MANAGEMENT:**
Tenant Management is for managing organizations/companies that use the platform. Each tenant has:
- Company information (name, logo, brand colors)
- Subscription plan and billing details
- Usage metrics (conversations, leads, tokens)
- AI agents and training data
- Custom settings and configurations

**What Super Admins Can Do:**
- View all tenants on the platform
- Change subscription plans and billing periods
- Manage trial periods (extend, expire, reset)
- Update tenant status (Active, Disabled)
- Monitor usage and analytics
- Track revenue and profit margins

**When to Use:**
- Managing company subscriptions
- Adjusting feature limits and trial periods
- Monitoring usage and costs
- Analyzing platform-wide performance
- Handling billing and payment issues

---

**QUICK COMPARISON:**

| Aspect | User Management | Tenant Management |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| What it manages | Individual login accounts | Organizations/companies |
| Key actions | Create users, assign roles, delete accounts | Manage plans, trials, billing |
| Primary focus | Access control & permissions | Subscriptions & usage |
| Example | Add a new admin for XYZ Corp | Upgrade XYZ Corp to Pro plan |

**Example Workflow:**
1. First, create a tenant (organization) in Tenant Management
2. Then, create a user account in User Management
3. Assign that user to the tenant with "Admin" role
4. The user can now log in and manage their tenant's AI agents

### How do I control costs and optimize token usage?

**Cost Control Best Practices:**

1. **Optimize Training Data:**
   - Remove duplicate documents
   - Keep website crawls focused (don't crawl entire sites)
   - Use concise, relevant content only
   - Limit training contexts to what's necessary

2. **Configure Agent Settings:**
   - Set response style to "Concise" instead of "Detailed" for cost savings
   - Use shorter custom instructions
   - Avoid redundant agent descriptions

3. **Monitor Usage:**
   - Check Analytics dashboard regularly
   - Review token usage trends
   - Set up usage alerts (Pro plan)
   - Upgrade before hitting limits to avoid service interruption

4. **Smart Plan Selection:**
   - Start with Trial to test token consumption
   - Estimate monthly usage based on expected conversation volume
   - Choose plan with 20% buffer above estimated usage
   - Pro plan offers best value for high-volume usage

**Super Admin Controls:**
- View real-time token costs per tenant
- Track profit margins
- Set custom token limits
