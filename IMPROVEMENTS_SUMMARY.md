# Chat System Improvements & Pricing Recommendations

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Anonymous Chat History Capture
**Problem:** Anonymous conversations were not being saved when users refreshed or left the session.

**Solution Implemented:**
- All conversations (both with contact info and anonymous) are now saved to the `leads` collection with full history
- Anonymous conversations are marked with `isAnonymous: true` flag
- Conversation history includes all messages with timestamps
- Fixed beforeunload handler to properly save conversations when users leave

### 2. ✅ Image Handling in Conversations
**Problem:** Images sent by users were not being saved with messages, and the full conversation history didn't include image data.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Updated Message interface to support both string and structured array content
- Images are saved with messages using `{ text: query, media: { url: imageDataUri } }` format
- AI properly receives and processes images via `imageDataUri` parameter
- Dashboard conversation viewer already supports displaying images in chat history

### 3. ✅ Token Usage Tracking
**Problem:** No token tracking for calculating costs and charging customers.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created token estimation utility (`src/lib/token-counter.ts`)
- Tracks tokens for both user messages and AI responses
- Tokens are saved with each message
- Total tokens calculated and saved per conversation/lead
- Analytics dashboard now shows "Tokens Used" instead of "Average Interaction"

## Pricing Strategy Based on Token Usage

### Current AI Costs (Gemini Models)
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: ~$0.075 per 1M input tokens, ~$0.30 per 1M output tokens
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: ~$1.25 per 1M input tokens, ~$5.00 per 1M output tokens
- **Average conversation**: ~500-2000 tokens (including context)
